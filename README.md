# MedScan: Smart AI Medical Diagnosis  

## Overview  
MedScan is an intelligent diagnostic system designed to analyze medical images (e.g., X-rays, MRIs) for early and accurate detection of diseases such as **pneumonia** and **tumors**. The system assists healthcare professionals by providing fast, reliable diagnoses, personalized treatment recommendations, and medication suggestions to improve patient outcomes.  

## Key Features  
✔ **Multi-Disease Detection** – Identifies pneumonia (from chest X-rays) and tumors (from MRI/CT scans) in a single system.  
✔ **AI-Powered Analysis** – Reduces human error and speeds up diagnosis compared to traditional manual methods.  
✔ **Personalized Treatment Suggestions** – Recommends treatments (e.g., antibiotics for pneumonia, surgical options for tumors).  
✔ **Medication Recommendations** – Suggests specific drugs and dosages based on diagnosis.  
✔ **User-Friendly Interface** – Clear visualization of results with confidence levels and actionable insights.  

## Problem Statement  
Current diagnostic methods rely on **manual image analysis**, which is time-consuming and error-prone. Existing AI solutions often focus on **single diseases** and lack **treatment guidance**. MedScan addresses these gaps by offering:  
- **Faster, more accurate detection** of multiple diseases.  
- **Actionable recommendations** for treatment and medication.  

## How It Works  
1. **Upload Medical Images** – Supports X-rays (for pneumonia) and MRI/CT scans (for tumors).  
2. **AI Analysis** – Deep learning models classify abnormalities with high accuracy.  
3. **Diagnosis & Recommendations** – Provides:  
   - Disease detection results with confidence scores.  
   - Tailored treatment options.  
   - Medication guidelines.  

## Benefits  
✅ **Early Detection** – Identifies diseases at an early stage for timely intervention.  
✅ **Reduced Workload** – Automates diagnosis, allowing doctors to focus on treatment.  
✅ **Scalable Solution** – Adaptable to additional diseases in the future.  

## Future Enhancements  
- **Expansion to more diseases** (e.g., tuberculosis, fractures).  
- **Integration with EHRs** (Electronic Health Records) for seamless patient data access.  
- **Real-time collaboration** between radiologists and AI.
